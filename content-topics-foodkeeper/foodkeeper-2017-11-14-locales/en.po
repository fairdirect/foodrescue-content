# This file provides an empty locale "en".
#   Since messages are identified by their English string in .po files and that 
#   string is used as the default for untranslated strings, the English locale 
#   needs no values. Just a single dummy translation to prevent Ruby's i18n gem 
#   from complaining ":en is not a valid locale".
